# Food-Plan

*a temporary name*

A web app for parents to use to track foods that have been offered to a child, built with flexibility to support families with different needs.

## What Problem Does it Solve

When raising a picky kid you're supposed to offer new foods over and over again. 
Parents and experts have many conflicting opinions about the best way to expand a palate. Regardless of the approach a parent takes, one of the most basic yet most challenging parts of feeding a child is serving them foods they don't want to eat, over and over and over.  The typical child can take 15-20 tries to accept some foods, and pickier kids can need twice as many.  It's hard to see tiny baby steps like taking a bite and spitting it out, smelling something and pulling a face, or not throwing a refused food on the floor as positives. 

All the feed-your-kid apps I've found have been kid-targeted, with lots of flashy rewards and persuasion. 
They don't help parents track how regularly they're introducing foods, they don't recognize baby steps, and they risk putting pressure on kids who feel anxious or inadequate during mealtime.

I wanted to build an app for collecting data about feeding kids, approaching the data in a way that centers the parents role in offering foods instead of whether the child eats them. I wanted to allow parents to record very small wins specific to their unique situation.
